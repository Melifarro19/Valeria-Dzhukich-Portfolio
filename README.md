## PROJECTS
### Case Study 1: Analysis of Student Balance Changes
A job for an online English school. They asked to look at how the number of classes on each student's balance was changing through time. 

#### Tasks
1. Use SQL queries to pull a table with data on student balances for each student for every day of the period.
2. See how each student's balance was affected by transactions and classes.
2. Analyse data on student balance changes pulled from the DB and discuss possible issues with data engineers and DB owners.
3. Visualise all the data and draw conclusions.

#### Solution
I worked with two DBs, `CLASSES` and `PAYMENTS`, and wrote a query using CTEs to get all the data required for the analysis. I needed to pull data such as the first transaction date for each student; a list of all dates for each student that are relevant to keep track of their balance; all balance changes (+ cumulative ones) for each student on each date (for transactions and classes), balance changes across the whole school for each date.
