## PROJECTS
### Case Study 1: Analysis of Student Balance Changes
A job for an online English school. They asked to look at how the number of classes on each student's balance was changing through time. 

#### Tasks
1. Use SQL queries to pull a table with data on student balances for each student for every day of the period.
2. See how each student's balance was affected by transactions and classes.
2. Analyse data on student balance changes pulled from the DB and discuss possible issues with data engineers and DB owners.
3. Visualise all the data and draw conclusions.

#### Solution
I worked with two DBs, `CLASSES` and `PAYMENTS`, and wrote an CTE to get all the data that I needed for the analysis.
Here are the stept to writing the final query:
- Pull the first transaction date for each student
- Create a list of all dates for the required period
- Pull a list of all dates for each student that are relevant to keep track of their balance
- Find all balance changes for each student on each day
